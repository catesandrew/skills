# Open PR (Azure DevOps)

Push the active branch and open an Azure DevOps pull request with a structured description, linked work items, reviewers, and optional auto-complete in one pass.

## Inputs

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `${input:org}` | Azure DevOps organization URL | `https://dev.azure.com/myorg` |
| `${input:project}` | ADO project name | `MyProject` |
| `${input:repo}` | Repository name | `my-service` |
| `${input:baseBranch}` | Target branch (default: `dev`) | `dev` |
| `${input:jiraBaseUrl}` | Issue tracker base URL (optional) | `https://jira.example.com/browse` |
| `${input:reviewers}` | Space-separated reviewer emails (optional) | `alice@example.com bob@example.com` |
| `${input:workItems}` | Space-separated work item IDs to link (optional) | `1234 5678` |
| `${input:draft}` | Open as draft PR — `true` or `false` (default: `false`) | `true` |
| `${input:autoComplete}` | Set auto-complete on creation — `true` or `false` | `false` |

## Phase 1: Setup and Pre-flight

### 1.1 Configure defaults
```bash
az devops configure --defaults organization=${input:org} project=${input:project}
```

### 1.2 Verify working tree is clean
```bash
git status --short
```
If uncommitted changes exist, describe them and ask the user whether to stash, commit, or abort.

### 1.3 Identify the active branch
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

### 1.4 Confirm the base branch
Default to `${input:baseBranch}`. If not provided, detect from repo:
```bash
az repos show --repository ${input:repo} --query defaultBranch -o tsv
# Returns e.g. refs/heads/dev — strip the prefix
```
Always confirm with the user — merging into the wrong branch can trigger unintended pipelines or release gates.

---

## Phase 2: Ticket and Work Item Discovery

### 2.1 Extract ticket from branch name
```bash
git branch --show-current
# Patterns: feature/PROJ-123-slug, PROJ-123/slug, PROJ-123-slug
```
Extract using: `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`

### 2.2 Fall back to commit messages
```bash
git log origin/${input:baseBranch}..HEAD --oneline
```
Search commit subjects for `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+` or ADO work item patterns (`#1234`).

### 2.3 Resolve work item IDs
If `${input:workItems}` is not provided, attempt to derive from the ticket:
```bash
az boards work-item show --id <id> --query "fields.\"System.Title\"" -o tsv
```
Confirm resolved work items with the user before linking.

### 2.4 Summarize commits for the Changes section
```bash
git log origin/${input:baseBranch}..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" --no-merges
```

---

## Phase 3: Push Branch

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

If rejected (non-fast-forward), investigate before force-pushing. Confirm with the user.

---

## Phase 4: Build PR Description

```markdown
### Ticket(s)

- [TICKET-xxx](${input:jiraBaseUrl}/TICKET-xxx)

### Changes

- <specific change 1: what changed, in which component, and why>
- <specific change 2>

### Tests

- <TestClassName>: <what was added or changed>
- No tests added or modified. ← only if true

### Notes

<optional: migration steps, rollback notes, feature flag, known limitations>
```

**Section rules:**
- **Ticket(s)**: omit if no tracker URL configured; ADO work item links are set separately via `--work-items`, not in the description body
- **Changes**: 1–5 bullets, non-test changes only; name the component and behavior, never just "fixed bug"
- **Tests**: one bullet per test file added/modified; explicitly state if no tests were touched
- **Notes**: include only if there are migration steps, feature flags, deployment ordering, or known limitations

---

## Phase 5: Create the PR

```bash
az repos pr create \
  --repository "${input:repo}" \
  --source-branch "$(git branch --show-current)" \
  --target-branch "${input:baseBranch}" \
  --title "[TICKET-xxx] <concise one-line summary>" \
  --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
### Ticket(s)
...
EOF
)" \
  --reviewers ${input:reviewers} \
  --work-items ${input:workItems} \
  $([ "${input:draft}" = "true" ] && echo "--draft true") \
  $([ "${input:autoComplete}" = "true" ] && echo "--auto-complete true") \
  --open
```

**Auto-complete note:** Setting `--auto-complete true` will merge the PR automatically once all policies pass (required reviewers approved, build succeeded, work items linked). Only enable if the branch is fully ready and the team uses policy-gated auto-complete.

---

## Phase 6: Post-creation Steps

```bash
# Print the PR URL
az repos pr show --id <prId> --query "repository.webUrl" -o tsv
```

If the branch policy requires a minimum reviewer count and `${input:reviewers}` was not provided, check the branch policy:
```bash
az repos policy list --branch "${input:baseBranch}" --repository-id \
  $(az repos show --repository ${input:repo} --query id -o tsv)
```

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting `az devops configure --defaults`** — Every `az repos` command needs org/project without defaults set. Do this first.
- **Wrong base branch** — Always confirm before pushing. Different branches may have different required reviewer policies and release gates.
- **Work items not linked** — ADO PRs without linked work items fail branch policies on many teams. Always link via `--work-items`, not just by mentioning the ID in the description.
- **Enabling auto-complete on a WIP branch** — Auto-complete triggers a merge as soon as policies pass. Never enable it on branches that are not fully ready.
- **Vague Changes bullets** — "Updated service" and "Fixed bug" tell reviewers nothing. Name the component, the behavior that changed, and why.
- **Skipping the Notes section when it matters** — Migration steps, feature flags, and deployment ordering buried in chat instead of the PR description cause incidents.
- **Draft vs non-draft confusion** — ADO draft PRs block voting and auto-complete. Use `--draft true` intentionally for WIP branches, and remember to publish before requesting review.
