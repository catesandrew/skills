# PR Code Review (GitHub)

Systematic, file-by-file code review that posts inline comments and a verdict directly to the GitHub PR. Reviews correctness, security, performance, and style — prioritized so the most important issues lead.

## Inputs

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `${input:pr}` | GitHub PR URL or number | `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42` or `42` |
| `${input:repo}` | `owner/repo` slug (inferred from URL if omitted) | `org/my-service` |

## Phase 1: Pre-Review Analysis

### 1.1 Fetch PR metadata
```bash
gh pr view ${input:pr} --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,author,labels,files,additions,deletions
```

Extract: title, description, base branch, linked issues (`Closes #...` in body), labels, total additions/deletions.

### 1.2 Fetch the diff
```bash
gh pr diff ${input:pr}
```

### 1.3 List changed files with stats
```bash
gh pr view ${input:pr} --json files --jq '.files[] | "\(.additions)+\(.deletions)-\t\(.path)"'
```

### 1.4 Check existing review comments to avoid duplication
```bash
gh pr view ${input:pr} --comments
gh api repos/${input:repo}/pulls/$(gh pr view ${input:pr} --json number -q .number)/comments
```

### 1.5 Identify PR type
Classify the change to calibrate review depth:
- **Bug fix** — focus on correctness and regression risk
- **Feature** — focus on design, edge cases, and test coverage
- **Refactor** — focus on behavioral equivalence and test coverage
- **Dependency update** — check changelog, breaking changes, security advisories
- **Config/infra change** — check environment parity and rollback safety

---

## Phase 2: Per-File Systematic Review

For each changed file, read the full file (not just the diff) to understand context:

```bash
gh api repos/${input:repo}/contents/<path>?ref=$(gh pr view ${input:pr} --json headRefName -q .headRefName) \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

Apply this checklist to each file and record findings as `{ path, line, body }` objects:

### Correctness (Critical)
- [ ] Does the logic match the stated intent in the PR description?
- [ ] Are all code paths handled, including null/undefined/empty inputs?
- [ ] Are error conditions caught and handled or propagated correctly?
- [ ] Are there off-by-one errors, incorrect comparisons, or wrong operator precedence?
- [ ] Are async operations awaited? Are race conditions possible?
- [ ] Does state mutation happen in the right order?

### Security (Critical)
- [ ] Is any user input used in SQL, shell commands, file paths, or HTML without sanitization?
- [ ] Are secrets, tokens, or PII logged or returned in responses?
- [ ] Are authorization checks present on every code path that accesses protected resources?
- [ ] Are dependencies added from trusted sources with pinned versions?
- [ ] Are file uploads, redirects, or deserializations safe?

### Best Practices (Medium)
- [ ] Does the code follow existing patterns in the codebase?
- [ ] Are functions and variables named clearly and consistently?
- [ ] Is error handling consistent with the rest of the codebase?
- [ ] Are magic numbers or hardcoded values extracted to constants?
- [ ] Is the change backward compatible, or are callers/consumers updated?

### Performance (Medium)
- [ ] Are there N+1 queries or unbounded loops over large data sets?
- [ ] Are expensive operations (network calls, disk I/O) called unnecessarily on hot paths?
- [ ] Are indexes or caches used where appropriate?
- [ ] Could any synchronous operation block the event loop or a thread pool?

### Style & Readability (Low)
- [ ] Is the code self-documenting? Would a new team member understand it?
- [ ] Are there dead code blocks, commented-out code, or leftover debug statements?
- [ ] Do not flag formatting if the project uses auto-formatters (Prettier, Black, gofmt, etc.).

---

## Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Concerns

Review these once across the whole PR (not per-file):

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Are there tests for every new function or branch of logic?
- [ ] Do existing tests still cover the changed behavior, or do they need updating?
- [ ] Are edge cases (empty input, max values, error paths) tested?
- [ ] Are tests meaningful — do they assert behavior, not just that code runs?

### Breaking Changes
- [ ] Are any public APIs, interfaces, or contracts changed without a version bump?
- [ ] Are any database columns/tables renamed or dropped without a migration?
- [ ] Are any environment variables renamed or removed?
- [ ] Are any message queue schemas changed in a way that breaks consumers?

### Dependencies
- [ ] Are new dependencies justified? Could the same be done with what is already in the project?
- [ ] Are new dependencies well-maintained and not flagged for known CVEs?
- [ ] Are lock files updated consistently with manifest files?

### Documentation
- [ ] Does a public-facing API or config change need a README or changelog update?
- [ ] Are new environment variables documented?

## Phase 4: Post Inline Comments and Verdict

### 4.1 Build the review payload

Collect all findings as a JSON review payload. Use `start_line`/`line` for multi-line comments.

```bash
# Parse owner/repo/number from PR URL or use inputs
OWNER_REPO="${input:repo}"
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view ${input:pr} --json number -q .number)

# Post review with inline comments in one API call
gh api repos/${OWNER_REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "body": "## Review Summary\n\n[Overall assessment paragraph]\n\n**Critical:** X issue(s)\n**Medium:** Y issue(s)\n**Low:** Z issue(s)",
  "event": "REQUEST_CHANGES",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/example.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "**Critical — null deref:** `user.profile` will throw if `user` is null. Use `user?.profile ?? defaultProfile`."
    },
    {
      "path": "src/api/handler.ts",
      "line": 18,
      "start_line": 15,
      "body": "**Security — missing auth check:** This endpoint modifies user data but has no authorization guard. Add a permission check before line 15."
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

**`event` values:**
| Value | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `APPROVE` | No blocking issues |
| `REQUEST_CHANGES` | One or more Critical or Medium issues |
| `COMMENT` | Questions or Low-only feedback, no verdict yet |

### 4.2 If no inline comments (file-level feedback only)

```bash
gh pr review ${input:pr} --request-changes --body "..."
gh pr review ${input:pr} --approve --body "..."
gh pr review ${input:pr} --comment --body "..."
```

### 4.3 Add a standalone comment for cross-cutting concerns

```bash
gh pr comment ${input:pr} --body "### Cross-cutting concerns\n\n- ..."
```

## Review Comment Format

Write inline comments so the author knows exactly what to change and why:

```
**[Severity] — [Category]:** [Specific problem].
[Why it matters.]
[Suggested fix or example if helpful.]
```

Examples:
- `**Critical — Security:** SQL query built with string concatenation on line 23. Parameterize the query: \`db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])\`.`
- `**Medium — Correctness:** \`retryCount\` is never reset between requests. Move initialization inside the request handler.`
- `**Low:** Unused import \`lodash/merge\` — remove to keep the bundle lean.`

---

## Tone Guidelines

- Be constructive and collaborative, not adversarial.
- Distinguish "must fix before merge" from "consider for a follow-up".
- Acknowledge what is done well.
- Ask questions when intent is unclear rather than assuming it is wrong.

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Posting comments without reading the full file** — Diff context is often misleading. Read the surrounding code to understand whether a finding is real.
- **Blocking on style when critical issues exist** — Post critical findings first. Style-only comments on broken code send the wrong signal.
- **Fragmented reviews** — Posting 10 separate `gh pr comment` calls instead of one `gh api reviews` call creates noise. Batch all inline comments into one review submission.
- **Vague comments** — "This could be better" is not actionable. Every comment must say what to change and why.
- **Duplicating existing feedback** — Check existing review threads before posting. Re-raising resolved issues wastes the author's time.
- **Approving without checking tests** — Always verify the test coverage section before setting `event: APPROVE`.
