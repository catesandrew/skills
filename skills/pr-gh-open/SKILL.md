# Open PR (GitHub)

Push the active branch and open a GitHub pull request with a structured description, linked ticket, reviewers, and labels in one pass.

## Inputs

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `${input:baseBranch}` | Target branch (default: `dev`) | `dev` |
| `${input:jiraBaseUrl}` | Issue tracker base URL (optional) | `https://jira.example.com/browse` |
| `${input:reviewers}` | Comma-separated GitHub usernames (optional) | `alice,bob` |
| `${input:labels}` | Comma-separated labels to apply (optional) | `feature,needs-review` |
| `${input:draft}` | Open as draft PR — `true` or `false` (default: `false`) | `true` |

## Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

### 1.1 Verify working tree is clean
```bash
git status --short
```
If uncommitted changes exist, describe them and ask the user whether to stash, commit, or abort.

### 1.2 Identify the active branch
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

### 1.3 Confirm the base branch
Default to `${input:baseBranch}`. If not provided, detect from repo conventions:
```bash
# Check for common integration branches in priority order
git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(dev|develop|main|master)$' | head -5
```
Always confirm with the user before proceeding — merging into the wrong branch can trigger unintended CI or deployment pipelines.

---

## Phase 2: Ticket and Commit Discovery

### 2.1 Extract ticket from branch name first
Branch naming conventions typically embed the ticket:
```bash
git branch --show-current
# Patterns: feature/PROJ-123-slug, PROJ-123/slug, PROJ-123-slug
```
Extract using: `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`

### 2.2 Fall back to commit messages
```bash
git log origin/${input:baseBranch}..HEAD --oneline
```
Search commit subjects for the same `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+` pattern.

### 2.3 Summarize commits for the Changes section
```bash
git log origin/${input:baseBranch}..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" --no-merges
```
Use these commit subjects as the raw material for the Changes bullets — rewrite them as human-readable descriptions, not raw commit messages.

---

## Phase 3: Push Branch

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

If the push is rejected (non-fast-forward), investigate before force-pushing. Confirm with the user.

---

## Phase 4: Build PR Description

Use this template — populate every section from the commit log and diff:

```markdown
### Ticket(s)

- [TICKET-xxx](${input:jiraBaseUrl}/TICKET-xxx)

### Changes

- <specific change 1: what changed, in which component, and why>
- <specific change 2>

### Tests

- <TestClassName>: <what was added or changed>
- No tests added or modified. ← only if true

### Notes

<optional: migration steps, rollback notes, feature flag, known limitations>
```

**Section rules:**
- **Ticket(s)**: omit if no tracker URL is configured
- **Changes**: 1–5 bullets, non-test changes only; never write "fixed bug" — name the component and behavior
- **Tests**: one bullet per test file added/modified with a brief description; explicitly state if no tests were touched
- **Notes**: include only if there are migration steps, a feature flag to toggle, deployment order requirements, or known limitations

---

## Phase 5: Create the PR

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base "${input:baseBranch}" \
  --title "[TICKET-xxx] <concise one-line summary>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
### Ticket(s)
...
EOF
)" \
  --reviewer "${input:reviewers}" \
  --label "${input:labels}" \
  $([ "${input:draft}" = "true" ] && echo "--draft")
```

If `${input:reviewers}` is not provided, check for a `CODEOWNERS` file:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/CODEOWNERS --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```
Suggest owners for the changed paths and ask the user to confirm before adding.

---

## Phase 6: Post-creation Steps

```bash
# Print the PR URL
gh pr view --web 2>/dev/null || gh pr view --json url -q .url
```

Optionally apply AI governance label if the session was AI-assisted:
```bash
gh pr edit <number> --add-label "ai-assisted"
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Wrong base branch** — Always confirm before pushing. `dev` vs `main` can trigger different deployment pipelines.
- **Pushing before confirming base** — Push after the base branch is confirmed, not before.
- **Vague Changes bullets** — "Fixed bug" and "Updated service" tell reviewers nothing. Name the component, the behavior that changed, and why.
- **Skipping the Notes section when it matters** — Migration steps, feature flags, and deployment ordering buried in Slack instead of the PR description cause incidents.
- **Forgetting draft mode for WIP branches** — If the branch is not ready for review, open as draft to prevent accidental merges.
- **Adding reviewers without checking CODEOWNERS** — Auto-assigning random teammates instead of the actual owners wastes everyone's time.
